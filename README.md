# VQB27
Small project for controlling two seven-segment displays (VQB27) with an Arduino Nano.

# About VQB27

This project utilizes two VQB27 seven-segment displays. Information on the VQB27 is really tight, only thing know about it is that it was manufactured in the GDR.

# Introduction

The VQB27, a SS126 NPN and an Arduino Nano were used in  this project. A custom PCB was designed and manufactured to have a somewhat functional two digit display thats also decent looking and not like a bomb on a breadboard.
